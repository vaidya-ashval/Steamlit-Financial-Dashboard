# Steamlit-Financial-Dashboard

## Dashboard

This project is a **Python** programming assignment where I constructed a dashboard to present the financial data extracted from **Yahoo Finance** service together with some financial analyses.

The dashboard includes the following tabs:

**Summary**: This tab presents the summary information of the stock, including the stock price, volume, market capitalization, and other key metrics. It also shows a chart of the stock price over time.

**Chart**: This tab allows users to interactively visualize the stock price over time. They can select the date range, time interval, and chart type.

**Financials**: This tab presents the financial information of the stock, including the income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement. Users can select the time period (annual or quarterly) for the financial statements.

**Monte Carlo simulation**: This tab conducts a Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the future stock price. Users can select the number of simulations and the time horizon.

**Your own analysis**: This tab is for my own analysis of the stock. I can add any financial analyses or additional information that I am interested in.
The dashboard is built using Python and the Streamlit library. It is deployed on the Streamlit Community Cloud.
